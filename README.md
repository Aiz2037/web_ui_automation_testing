# automationTesting
=======
This project demonstrates my skill in using Java, Selenium Webdriver and TestNG framework to automate web application testing.

In this project, I have developed automated test scripts with key focus on testing the functionalities of OrangeHRM application.

In addition, I have created test cases to be automated which also encompass both positive and negative scenarios, to ensure the testing has wider coverage. 

OrangeHRM Inc. is a HR software company based in Secaucus, New Jersey, best known for its Human resource management system. The main page of OrangeHRM contains many user interfaces which allow users to interact the web elements.

The framework is splitted into 2 sections which are development part and execution part. For development part, comprised of page object and test cases, which being supplemented by test data, utilities and resources. Page object files contain declaration of web elements and methods that imitate different functions in the website.

The test cases file will access the page object file to be used in different part of its program in order to automate the web application.
